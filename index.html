                    <div>
                        <h1>Model 1</h1>
                        <p>
                            This is the first machine learning-model I made. The
                            accuracy was 98% and I was super proud. When I tried
                            it out on the web it performed poorly. Turns out the
                            mnist dataset is centered and scaled in a certain
                            way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This model problems are scale and positioning. If
                            you center your drawing and don't draw to big or to
                            small it works, else it is really bad. You have to
                            help it for it to guess right.
                        </p>

                    <img
                        src="data_1.png"
                        alt="A picture of the number four in black and white. The picture is pixlated"
                    />
                </div>
                <div id="model2">
                    <div>
                        <h1>Model 2</h1>
                        <p>
                            Data augmentation was the solution. I shifted the
                            numbers randomly and rotated them randomly. I was
                            able to scale them up but scaling down was not
                            possible the way I did it. I thought it would be
                            enough with movment and rotation. Scaling up was
                            just extra. It worked well but I was wrong. Scaling
                            down would help the model improve a lot.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The main problem with this model is small numbers
                            work bad, especially if they are not in the center.
                        </p>

                        alt="Two pictures of the number 4, both are pixlated but one is bigger than the other. The pictures are also in black in white"
                    />

                <div id="model3">

                        <h1>Model 3</h1>
                        <p>
                            This model is the third and final. It addresses all
                            the previous problems. It shifts and rotates
                            randomly. The numbers are also scaled up and down
                            randomly. The last thing I added was some noise that
                            helped the model generalize more.
